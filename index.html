                I worked as a full-service attendant, pumping gas and performing
                other services including: airing tires, washing windows, and
                checking oil for customers. I worked the counter and stocked
                products.

                I am a laser cutter machine operator cutting components to be
                assembled into bending sections for medical scopes. When needed,
                I also operate a stamping press which forms these compents to
                the necessary shapes for assembly.

          <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">
            I desire to enter a career in web development in order to be able to
            provide for my growing family and to develop web applications to
            assist in teaching Ancient Greek and Hebrew. My dream project is to
            create an immersive website in the ancient languages which
            automatically determines the necessary activities to help the user
            learn. It will incorporate video lessons, short stories, graded
            readers, and more all for free. Given my enjoyment of language
            learning, I would also like to learn a modern language—ideally for
            use in my future career.
