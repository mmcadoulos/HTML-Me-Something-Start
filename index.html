                I worked as a full-service attendant, pumping gas and performing

                checking oil for customers. I worked the counter and stocked

                I am a laser cutter machine operator cutting components to be
                assembled into bending sections for medical scopes. When needed,
                I also operate a stamping press which forms these components to
                the necessary shapes for assembly.

          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            Firstly, I am a devoted follower of Jesus the Christ. I have a beautiful wife
            named Ruth and a son named Moses. My interests include: Rollerblading, Ancient Greek (emphasis on <dfn title="The form of Greek from 323BC up to 1453AD">Post-Classical Greek</dfn>), and Biblical Hebrew (some fun examples below). My wife and I enjoy inline skating together when the weather is nice and we have the spare time. It is a great form of exercise and extremely fun! My love for Greek and Hebrew came from a desire to read the Christian Scriptures in their original form. I am pursuing a level of spoken and reading fluency in them in order to pass the skill down to my children and to others who desire to learn.

            I desire to enter a career in web development in order to be able to
            provide for my growing family and to develop web applications to
            assist in teaching Ancient Greek and Hebrew. My dream project is to
            create an immersive website in the ancient languages which
            automatically determines the necessary activities to help the user
            learn. It will incorporate video lessons, short stories, graded
            readers, and more all for free. Given my enjoyment of language
            learning, I would also like to learn a modern language—ideally for
            use in my future career.
